# Backend Integration Subplan

## Overview
Implement the integration between the Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend, ensuring proper communication and data flow between the two systems.

## Problem Description
The application needs to:
- Connect Angular services to backend REST endpoints
- Handle HTTP requests and responses properly
- Implement error handling and loading states
- Manage data transformation between frontend and backend models

## Goals
1. Implement HTTP interceptors for authentication
2. Create service layer abstractions for API calls
3. Handle backend errors consistently
4. Implement proper data transformation
5. Manage loading states during API calls

## Implementation Details
1. Create HTTP interceptors for:
   - [ ] Authentication token management
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Loading state management
2. Implement service layers for:
   - [ ] Users service
   - [ ] Groups service
   - [ ] Permissions service
3. Create data transformation layers:
   - [ ] User DTOs and mappers
   - [ ] Group DTOs and mappers
   - [ ] Permission DTOs and mappers
4. Implement error handling:
   - [ ] Global error interceptor
   - [ ] Error display service
   - [ ] Error boundary components
5. Add loading state management:
   - [ ] Loading interceptor
   - [ ] Loading service
   - [ ] Loading indicators in UI

## Additional Notes
- Use Angular HttpClient for API calls
- Implement proper retry strategies
- Handle token refresh flows
- Consider implementing caching where appropriate
