[Coding Aider Plan]

## Overview
Implement the integration between the Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend, ensuring proper communication and data flow between the two systems.

## Problem Description
The application needs to:
- Connect Angular services to backend REST endpoints
- Handle HTTP requests and responses properly
- Implement error handling and loading states
- Manage data transformation between frontend and backend models

## Goals
1. Implement HTTP interceptors for authentication
2. Create service layer abstractions for API calls
3. Handle backend errors consistently
4. Implement proper data transformation
5. Manage loading states during API calls

## Additional Notes
- Use Angular HttpClient for API calls
- Implement proper retry strategies
- Handle token refresh flows
- Consider implementing caching where appropriate
