[Coding Aider Plan]

## Overview
This subplan focuses on integrating the frontend with Gradle, using a Gradle Node plugin to delegate tasks to Node.js. The frontend will use the OpenAPI JSON specification to generate Angular API client code.

## Problem Description
The frontend currently lacks a Gradle project to manage its build process, and it does not utilize the OpenAPI JSON specification for API client generation.

## Goals
- Set up a Gradle project for the frontend.
- Use the Gradle Node plugin to manage Node.js tasks.
- Generate Angular API client code from the OpenAPI JSON specification.

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- Ensure compatibility with existing Node.js and Angular configurations.
- Automate the API client generation process as part of the build.
