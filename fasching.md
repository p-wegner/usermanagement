# Fasching: The German Carnival

In winter's grip when days are cold,
A festive spirit breaks the mold.
Fasching comes with colors bright,
Filling German streets with light.

Masks and costumes, wild and free,
Dancing, singing, full of glee.
From Weiberfastnacht's women's day,
To Rosenmontag's grand parade.

Confetti rains from skies above,
As strangers share in joy and love.
Krapfen sweet with jam inside,
A treat that none can cast aside.

For weeks the revelry goes on,
Until the Lenten time has dawned.
Then Aschermittwoch marks the end,
As normal life returns again.

But memories of this joyous time,
Remain in heart through summer's prime.
Till next year when once more we'll see,
The German Fasching's jubilee.
