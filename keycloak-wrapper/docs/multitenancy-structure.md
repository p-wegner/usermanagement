# Keycloak Multitenancy Structure Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the structure and organization of multitenancy support in our Keycloak implementation. It explains how customers, tenants, groups, roles, and users are organized and related to each other.

## Group Structure

### Top-Level Organization

```
/
├── tenant_CustomerA
│   ├── TenantA_admins
│   ├── RoleGroup1
│   ├── RoleGroup2
│   └── ...
├── tenant_CustomerB
│   ├── TenantB_admins
│   ├── RoleGroup1
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- **Tenant Groups**: Top-level groups with the prefix `tenant_` represent customer tenants
- **Admin Groups**: Each tenant has an admin group with the suffix `_admins`
- **Role Groups**: Subgroups within a tenant represent functional roles or permissions

### Group Attributes

Groups use attributes to store metadata:

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `isTenant` | Marks a group as a tenant | `true` |
| `tenantName` | Display name for the tenant | `"Customer A"` |

## Role Structure

### Realm Roles

- **System Roles**: Global roles that apply across all tenants
  - `ADMIN`: System administrators with full access
  - `TENANT_ADMIN`: Tenant administrators with access to specific tenants

### Client Roles

- **Application-Specific Roles**: Roles specific to client applications
- **Tenant-Specific Client Roles**: For complex applications, client roles can be scoped to tenants using naming conventions

## User Management

### User Assignment

- Users are assigned to tenant groups to grant them access to that tenant
- Users can be assigned to admin groups to make them tenant administrators
- Users can be assigned realm roles directly or via group membership

### User Attributes

Users can have attributes to store tenant-specific metadata:

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `tenant_id` | Primary tenant ID | `"tenant_CustomerA"` |
| `managed_tenants` | List of tenant IDs the user can manage | `["tenant_CustomerA", "tenant_CustomerB"]` |

## Access Control Rules

1. **System Admins** (`ADMIN` role):
   - Can access and manage all tenants, groups, roles, and users

2. **Tenant Admins** (`TENANT_ADMIN` role):
   - Can only access and manage users, groups, and roles within their assigned tenants
   - Cannot modify system roles or access other tenants

3. **Regular Users**:
   - Can only access resources within their assigned tenant(s)
   - Cannot manage other users or assign roles

## API Security

The API enforces these access control rules through:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Endpoints are secured with role requirements
2. **Tenant Isolation**: The `TenantSecurityEvaluator` verifies tenant access
3. **Data Filtering**: Results are filtered based on the user's tenant access

## Tenant Onboarding Process

1. Create a new tenant group with the `tenant_` prefix
2. Create an admin subgroup with the `_admins` suffix
3. Create role subgroups as needed
4. Assign appropriate roles to the groups
5. Add users to the tenant group and admin group as needed

## Maintenance Considerations

- When creating new roles, they should be added to all tenant groups
- When deleting roles, they should be removed from all tenant groups
- Tenant admin assignments should be managed through the API to ensure proper role assignment
